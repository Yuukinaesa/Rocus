# Root and Custom ROM (Rocus) - Android Application

This application was designed for users with medium-specification cellphones, aiming to enhance performance in cases where vendors have imposed limitations.
The primary goal of this application is to provide performance optimization that isn't constrained by vendor restrictions, along with customizable options to enhance the visual appeal of the cellphone, aligning it with the user's expectations. All of this is accomplished without the need to replace the existing cellphone with a new smartphone.
